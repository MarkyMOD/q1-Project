Proposal 1

I aim to bring the mobile experience, to desktop. I would evolutionize the desktop itself, while at the same time, forcing mobile to take a step back. The site would be hosted at non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com (no w's needed), and feature a multitude of apps.

The main app would be, the internet. Which I believe will bring back the official capitalization of, Internet. When you click on the Internet app, it will take you to the internet (or, Internet). The browser will be a combination of FireFox, which is the best browser, Chrome, Safari, and some opera singers. What is truly evolutionary, is the fact you will remain on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com, while browsing the entire Internet! *if the embedded JavaScript is working properly, you should be seeing doves released, at this point* The combined browser window will take up roughly 99% of the window on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com, and be a part of the website. Of course, you will be able to visit non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com from your current browser on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com. You will be able to access the Internet app on this, and any, nested browser, creating a truly unique website experience, no matter where you roam. As long as you are in the presence of your non-mobile desktop, while on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com. Our browsers cascade, in style.

Another app will be the Phone app, which will connect you to an internet phone service. Our (I expect to have significant funding, and a full team, by this time tomorrow) third app, will be the Message app. It will bring up the iMessage application on any Macs, and an error message on everything else. That error message will begin with "HEY STUPID,".

This will be a step back for mobile devices because I expect everyone to throw them away, and donate them to old people, upon the release of this product. People need this. People want this. They just don't know it yet (-Steve Jobs).


Proposal 2

I want to create a website that lets you choose your mood, and then, based on the mood selected, randomly choose for you a board game to play, an audiobook to be whispered in the background, food to cook for the festivities, a beer to pair with that food, a whisk(e)y to be enjoyed as dessert, and hip-hop music to be blasted over the audiobook, while a movie is played on the TV. I would also let the user select how much time they have for gaming, how long they have for cooking beforehand, book category, and how many people will be attending this delightful event.

These are some of my favorite things, and while people may not want to combine all of these at once, it could help them select one, or more, to enjoy, based on their current mood.

Users of my site would be fans of the respected categories, and certainly ones who revel in combining all seven, or anyone looking to try out one, or more, of these things.

To create this website, I will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly Mocha, Chai, and APIs. A stretch goal is to link to information on the board games, movies, lyrics, beer, whisk(e)y, recipe, and author of the book.

This is my favorite idea, and I would enjoy creating it, but am not all that satisfied with it. I hope to have a better idea by tonight, and will be drinking some brain juice with cool, brilliant people to facilitate that process. This shall not fail.

Proposal 1 v2

Prison Tinder. Somehow, someway, serial killers get enough groupies to make aging rockstars jealous. But what about those in prison with less than a life sentence?? Not everyone... ok, that's enough of that. You can thank my stupid ass friend (and rumblr) for that idea (just kidding, she's great, and very smart, rumblr sucks, but maybe it would help with aggression in society?? Think there's gyms for that though).

Proposal 2 v2

Beer Study. Every time someone is helped with a moderate, or harder, programming, or just life, problem, they owe that person a beer, assuming all parties agree to the beerness. Instructors are a magnitude of order higher (to reflect their relative knowledge, a magnitude of order of a magnitude of order might be more realistic, but would never get you beer), and need to help a student 10 times, before receiving a "beer owed" tally. Every 3, or so, beer tallies could have the option of being exchanged for a decent cocktail, glass of wine, or whisk(e)y. It would be redeemed at the end of the Q4, and could be wiped clean with the performance of one karaoke song, to be chosen by the person they owe beer to. So, one song per unique person they owe beer to.

This would help people who like beer, and also like to help others. It may also motivate people to help others, for the beer. May also be a fun tool that alleviates working together, and acts as a talking point you could always fall back on.

Users would be people in g106, maybe g103, maybe everyone who likes beer/drinks, I don't know.

I would be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Maybe Mocha, Chai, and a database. Computer(s), internet.

This would work best as an app, or at least something that worked very well on mobile internet. Would work best with a database, which I should be able to do. Was talking to a friend who said it wasn't too hard/they'd show me. An alternative would be letting users write code to some specific fields. By that, I mean they could enter name, who owes them beer, how much, etc, and my code would alter the entire page with that information. This would obviously rely on the honor policy of users... Maybe I could allow something to be added, but not removed, or altered. I could write something to group the same names (first and last) together, so beers owed would be organized, and readable. I could require a secret password for admittance to the site.

MVP would be my mother. She worked really hard to raise me, and I wasn't always the easiest... Oh. What? Minimum Viable Product? Oh, that's different. That would be a webpage that kept track of what beers were owed to whom, along with a clear explanation of the concept. Think that would be it...

Anthony and myself came up with a similar idea to this around week 1, so if he wants to use this idea for his project, he can have at it. Talking to him though, it seems like he wasn't going to.

Proposal 1

I aim to bring the mobile experience, to desktop. I would evolutionize the desktop itself, while at the same time, forcing mobile to take a step back. The site would be hosted at non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com (no w's needed), and feature a multitude of apps.

The main app would be, the internet. Which I believe will bring back the official capitalization of, Internet. When you click on the Internet app, it will take you to the internet (or, Internet). The browser will be a combination of FireFox, which is the best browser, Chrome, Safari, and some opera singers. What is truly evolutionary, is the fact you will remain on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com, while browsing the entire Internet! *if the embedded JavaScript is working properly, you should be seeing doves released, at this point* The combined browser window will take up roughly 99% of the window on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com, and be a part of the website. Of course, you will be able to visit non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com from your current browser on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com. You will be able to access the Internet app on this, and any, nested browser, creating a truly unique website experience, no matter where you roam. As long as you are in the presence of your non-mobile desktop, while on non-mobileDesktopDeployingMobileTechnology.com. Our browsers cascade, in style.

Another app will be the Phone app, which will connect you to an internet phone service. Our (I expect to have significant funding, and a full team, by this time tomorrow) third app, will be the Message app. It will bring up the iMessage application on any Macs, and an error message on everything else. That error message will begin with "HEY STUPID,".

This will be a step back for mobile devices because I expect everyone to throw them away, and donate them to old people, upon the release of this product. People need this. People want this. They just don't know it yet (-Steve Jobs).


Proposal 2

I want to create a website that lets you choose your mood, and then, based on the mood selected, randomly choose for you a board game to play, an audiobook to be whispered in the background, food to cook for the festivities, a beer to pair with that food, a whisk(e)y to be enjoyed as dessert, and hip-hop music to be blasted over the audiobook, while a movie is played on the TV. I would also let the user select how much time they have for gaming, how long they have for cooking beforehand, book category, and how many people will be attending this delightful event.

These are some of my favorite things, and while people may not want to combine all of these at once, it could help them select one, or more, to enjoy, based on their current mood.

Users of my site would be fans of the respected categories, and certainly ones who revel in combining all seven, or anyone looking to try out one, or more, of these things.

To create this website, I will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly Mocha, Chai, and APIs. A stretch goal is to link to information on the board games, movies, lyrics, beer, whisk(e)y, recipe, and author of the book.

This is my favorite idea, and I would enjoy creating it, but am not all that satisfied with it. I hope to have a better idea by tonight, and will be drinking some brain juice with cool, brilliant people to facilitate that process. This shall not fail.
